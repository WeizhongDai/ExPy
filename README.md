Description
-----------

ExPy allows the use of Python in Excel by loading Python into the same
process as excel and exposing function using the Excel Addin
interface. This is a relatively high-performance and robust interface
mechanism. ExcelDNA works in a similar way (providing interfacing to
.Net languages) as well many other application-specific Excel addins.

Alternatives ways of interfacing are via COM (e.g., excelpython,
https://github.com/ericremoreynolds/excelpython ) or client/server
architectures (e.g., I believe xlloop).
